## How to install and run the code 
You can directly export this repository or clone it to your local,

code can be run using your favorite text editor, 
1. open the terminal
2. type "php artisan serve" in the terminal that you have opened
3. there will be a local link there, hold down the ctrl key and click the link

there are two forms that can be filled out based on the path here, first
1. "/" will display the form for cover 
2. "/si" will display the form for student's identity

I personally don't feel satisfied yet, I will continue to update every day until I feel enough

*note
I'm still having trouble rendering images, because dompdf can't render them, and it takes a long time to render and eventually fails.
